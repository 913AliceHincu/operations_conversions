# operations_conversions

The application must implement algorithms for: 
* **arithmetic operations** for positive integers: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division by one digit, in a base p={2,3,...,9,10,16}
*	**conversions** of natural numbers between two bases p,q={2,3,...,9,10,16} using the substitution method or successive divisions and rapid conversions between two bases p,q={2, 4, 8, 16}. 

And  must have a menu such that all operations and conversion methods to be verified separately.

* 1p - algorithm for the method of successive divisions 
* 1p - algorithm for the substitution method 
* 1p â€“ algorithm for conversion using 10 as an intermediate base
* 2p - rapid conversions (executable form) between two bases p,q={2, 4, 8, 16}.
* 1p addition of two numbers in a base
* 1p subtraction of two numbers in a base
* 1p multiplication of a number by a digit in a base
* 1p division of a number by a digit in a base
* 1p code quality (indentation, use of comments, suggestive variables names)
